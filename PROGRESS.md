## ✅ **COMPLETED TASKS**

### Project Setup (Week 1)
- [x] **Project Structure:** Created modular architecture with src/, tests/, config/
- [x] **Documentation:** PROJECT_PLAN.md, PROJECT_QUESTIONS.md, README.md
- [x] **Development Environment:** requirements.txt, Makefile, pytest.ini, setup.py
- [x] **Version Control:** Git initialization, .gitignore, initial commit
- [x] **Configuration:** settings.py, .env.example for Discogs API

### Phase 1.2: Discogs API Integration (Completed)
- [x] **Discogs API Client:** Full-featured client with rate limiting (60 req/min)
- [x] **Collection Fetching:** Pagination support for large collections
- [x] **Caching System:** SQLite-based cache with TTL and statistics
- [x] **Cached Client:** High-level interface combining API + caching
- [x] **Test Suite:** Comprehensive tests with 19 test cases (all passing)

## 🔄 **CURRENT FOCUS**
**Phase 1.3: Test with Real Discogs Data**

### Next Immediate Tasks:
1. **Set up .env file** with your Discogs credentials
2. **Test API connection** and fetch your collection
3. **Analyze collection data** to understand feature patterns
4. **Prepare for feature engineering** phase

### Ready to Move to Phase 2: Feature Engineering
Once real data testing is complete, we'll begin:
- Genre/style feature extraction
- Artist similarity computation
- TF-IDF for album descriptions
- Personal preference weights

---

## 🎯 **UPCOMING PHASES**

### Phase 2: Feature Engineering (Weeks 2-3)
- Genre/style feature extraction
- Artist similarity computation  
- TF-IDF for album descriptions
- Personal preference weights

### Phase 3: Model Development (Weeks 3-4)
- Content-based filtering algorithm
- Confidence scoring mechanism
- Model validation pipeline

### Phase 4: Backend API (Weeks 4-5)
- FastAPI endpoints
- Model serving infrastructure
- Database integration

### Phase 5: Frontend (Weeks 5-6)
- React mobile-first interface
- Recommendation display
- User feedback collection

---

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL DECISIONS MADE**

1. **Individual Model:** Personal model for your collection (not collaborative)
2. **Content-Based:** Genre, artist, label, style features (no collaborative filtering V1)
3. **Tech Stack:** FastAPI + React + SQLite + scikit-learn
4. **Deployment:** Local development, free APIs only
5. **Latency:** 25-30 second acceptable response time

---

## 📝 **REQUIREMENTS SUMMARY**
- **V1 Goal:** Personal vinyl recommendation with confidence scores
- **Target User:** You (single user for V1)
- **Data Source:** Your Discogs collection + free APIs
- **Output:** Buy/don't buy recommendations with confidence %
- **Interface:** Mobile-first web app

## 🚀 **HOW TO CONTINUE**

### For New Claude Sessions:
1. **Read this file first** for current progress
2. **Review PROJECT_PLAN.md** for detailed roadmap  
3. **Check PROJECT_QUESTIONS.md** for requirements context
4. **Look at todo list** in current work

### Development Commands:
```bash
# Setup environment
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt

# Development workflow  
make format    # Format code
make lint      # Check code quality
make test      # Run tests
make dev       # Start development server

# Next step: Implement Discogs API
python -m src.data.discogs_client sync
```

### GitHub Repository:
**Status:** Ready to push (commit created)
**Next:** Create repo at github.com/new and push with:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/[username]/vinyl-recommendation-system.git  
git push -u origin main
```

## 💡 **CONTEXT FOR AI ASSISTANTS**
- This is a **personal project** for learning and actual use
- **Individual content-based model** trained on user's Discogs collection
- **Mobile-first design** for use in record stores
- **Free-tier APIs only** - no paid services
- **Iterative development** - start simple, add features gradually

**Current Priority:** Discogs API integration for data collection
