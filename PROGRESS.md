## üîÑ **CURRENT FOCUS**
**Phase 2.2: Recommendation Model Development**

### Feature Engineering Results (COMPLETED):
- **173 features extracted** from 7 different feature types
- **94.53% sparsity** - efficient for similarity computation
- **Strong discriminative features:** decade_2020s, style_Alternative Rock, style_Indie Rock
- **User profile learned:** 88% contemporary preference, Rock-focused with metal elements
- **Successfully tested** on real collection data

### Next Immediate Tasks:
1. **Build Content-Based Recommender** - Core similarity-based recommendation engine
2. **Implement Confidence Scoring** - Buy/Maybe/Skip decisions with confidence levels
3. **Add Recommendation Reasoning** - Human-readable explanations for decisions
4. **Create Recommendation Pipeline** - End-to-end system for new album evaluation
5. **Test with Real Albums** - Validate recommendations against known preferences

---

## üéØ **UPCOMING PHASES**

### Phase 2: Feature Engineering (Weeks 2-3)
- Genre/style feature extraction
- Artist similarity computation  
- TF-IDF for album descriptions
- Personal preference weights

### Phase 3: Model Development (Weeks 3-4)
- Content-based filtering algorithm
- Confidence scoring mechanism
- Model validation pipeline

### Phase 4: Backend API (Weeks 4-5)
- FastAPI endpoints
- Model serving infrastructure
- Database integration

### Phase 5: Frontend (Weeks 5-6)
- React mobile-first interface
- Recommendation display
- User feedback collection

---

## üîß **TECHNICAL DECISIONS MADE**

1. **Individual Model:** Personal model for your collection (not collaborative)
2. **Content-Based:** Genre, artist, label, style features (no collaborative filtering V1)
3. **Tech Stack:** FastAPI + React + SQLite + scikit-learn
4. **Deployment:** Local development, free APIs only
5. **Latency:** 25-30 second acceptable response time

---

## üìù **REQUIREMENTS SUMMARY**
- **V1 Goal:** Personal vinyl recommendation with confidence scores
- **Target User:** You (single user for V1)
- **Data Source:** Your Discogs collection + free APIs
- **Output:** Buy/don't buy recommendations with confidence %
- **Interface:** Mobile-first web app
