## üîÑ **CURRENT FOCUS**
**Phase 2: Feature Engineering**

### Collection Analysis Results:
- **56 albums** with rich metadata patterns
- **82% Rock focus** with diverse subgenres (Alt Rock, Indie Rock, Post Rock, Death Metal)
- **Strong artist preferences:** Deafheaven (3), Godspeed You Black Emperor! (3), Radiohead (3)
- **Quality label patterns:** Relapse Records, Constellation, XL Recordings, 4AD
- **Modern collection:** 74% from 2010s-2020s, spanning 1965-2025

### Next Immediate Tasks:
1. **Genre/Style Feature Extraction** - Vectorize categorical music features
2. **Artist Similarity Computation** - Build artist relationship matrices  
3. **Label Preference Analysis** - Weight albums by label prestige/preference
4. **Temporal Features** - Year-based similarity and era preferences

---

## üéØ **UPCOMING PHASES**

### Phase 2: Feature Engineering (Weeks 2-3)
- Genre/style feature extraction
- Artist similarity computation  
- TF-IDF for album descriptions
- Personal preference weights

### Phase 3: Model Development (Weeks 3-4)
- Content-based filtering algorithm
- Confidence scoring mechanism
- Model validation pipeline

### Phase 4: Backend API (Weeks 4-5)
- FastAPI endpoints
- Model serving infrastructure
- Database integration

### Phase 5: Frontend (Weeks 5-6)
- React mobile-first interface
- Recommendation display
- User feedback collection

---

## üîß **TECHNICAL DECISIONS MADE**

1. **Individual Model:** Personal model for your collection (not collaborative)
2. **Content-Based:** Genre, artist, label, style features (no collaborative filtering V1)
3. **Tech Stack:** FastAPI + React + SQLite + scikit-learn
4. **Deployment:** Local development, free APIs only
5. **Latency:** 25-30 second acceptable response time

---

## üìù **REQUIREMENTS SUMMARY**
- **V1 Goal:** Personal vinyl recommendation with confidence scores
- **Target User:** You (single user for V1)
- **Data Source:** Your Discogs collection + free APIs
- **Output:** Buy/don't buy recommendations with confidence %
- **Interface:** Mobile-first web app

## üöÄ **HOW TO CONTINUE**

### For New Claude Sessions:
1. **Read this file first** for current progress
2. **Review PROJECT_PLAN.md** for detailed roadmap  
3. **Check PROJECT_QUESTIONS.md** for requirements context
4. **Look at todo list** in current work

### Development Commands:
```bash
# Setup environment
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt

# Development workflow  
make format    # Format code
make lint      # Check code quality
make test      # Run tests
make dev       # Start development server

# Next step: Implement Discogs API
python -m src.data.discogs_client sync
```

### GitHub Repository:
**Status:** Ready to push (commit created)
**Next:** Create repo at github.com/new and push with:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/[username]/vinyl-recommendation-system.git  
git push -u origin main
```

## üí° **CONTEXT FOR AI ASSISTANTS**
- This is a **personal project** for learning and actual use
- **Individual content-based model** trained on user's Discogs collection
- **Mobile-first design** for use in record stores
- **Free-tier APIs only** - no paid services
- **Iterative development** - start simple, add features gradually

**Current Priority:** Feature engineering for recommendation model

## üìä **COLLECTION ANALYSIS SUMMARY**
Your vinyl collection (56 albums) shows excellent patterns for content-based filtering:

### Musical Profile:
- **Dominant Genre:** Rock (82%) with Electronic (14%) elements
- **Subgenre Diversity:** Alternative Rock (29%), Indie Rock (23%), Post Rock (11%)
- **Metal Presence:** Death Metal, Black Metal, Progressive Metal (18% combined)
- **Era Focus:** Modern collector (74% from 2010s-2020s)

### Key Patterns for ML Model:
1. **Artist Loyalty:** Multiple albums from Deafheaven, Godspeed You Black Emperor!, Radiohead
2. **Label Quality:** Preference for indie/quality labels (Relapse, Constellation, XL, 4AD)
3. **Progressive Tendencies:** Strong presence of prog/experimental styles
4. **Consistency:** Clear taste profile suitable for recommendation modeling

**Data Quality:** ‚úÖ Excellent - Rich metadata, clear patterns, sufficient diversity
