# Vinyl Recommendation System - Project Plan

## üéØ Project Overview
Build a content-based vinyl recommendation system that analyzes your Discogs collection to predict whether you'll like new albums with confidence scores.

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Data Layer**: Discogs API integration + local caching
2. **ML Layer**: Content-based filtering with feature engineering  
3. **API Layer**: FastAPI backend for model serving
4. **UI Layer**: React frontend with mobile-first design
5. **Database**: SQLite for user data and recommendations

### Key Technical Decisions
- **Individual Model**: Personalized to your collection (not collaborative filtering)
- **Content-Based**: Genre, artist, label, year, style features
- **Real-time Inference**: 25-30 second latency budget
- **Local Deployment**: No cloud costs for V1
